# Lidar-Obstacle-Detection

In this project, a sequence of lidar point clouds are fed through a processing system, which highlights the road plane in green, and highlights various obstacles in alternating colors of blue, red, and yellow. Furthermore, bounding boxes are placed around these obstacles to create a 'zone of avoidance' representing areas in which the ego car (center of the point cloud) must not enter.

Completed code can be found in the src/ folder.
